# TODO / Progress

## Next steps

- build a real simple chickadee app - forget about catbird for now

- add the chickadee-vat connector to get goblins running in the chickadee
  event loop

- add a static neuron network - like the current ones but also with an x,y
  which controls where they are on the board

- add the neuron firing behaviour
- add some sounds

- much later - interactive building of networks
